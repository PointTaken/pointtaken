      <description>Dynamics 365 - Customer engagement 
Before you start, you should know that I am not a developer. I can’t answer questions about development directly. This is intended for functional consultants that want to be able to make simple plugins without any developer knowledge.

      <description>Updating single and multi value taxonomy fields using PnP-JS-Core 
Point Taken is the leading SharePoint, Office 365 and Nintex consultancy in Norway. 
All the devs in Point Taken are heavy users of the awesome repos provided on https://github.com/SharePoint. But even though our SharePoint dev lives have become easier we still encounter challenges and general SharePoint weirdness. This is one of those cases.
A little background: one of our clients wanted an application that would copy predefined tasks into project sites based on the project type.</description>
